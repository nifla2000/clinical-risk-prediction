# Clinical Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Hospital readmissions increase healthcare costs and indicate suboptimal patient outcomes.
This project analyzes clinical data to identify risk factors and builds a machine learning
model to predict patient readmission risk.

## Dataset
The Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset contains over 100,000 patient encounters with
demographic, diagnostic, and treatment-related features.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model training and evaluation

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall
- ROC-AUC

## Results

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Future Work
- Model deployment
- Bias analysis
- Model monitoring
